## What should I know before I get started?

### System Architecture
Reading the [wiki](https://github.com/ProjectAGI/agi/wiki) and the [documentation](./docs) should give you a good understanding of how the framework works, and how different system components interact. This will be particularly useful in debugging any issues you encounter, and for making valuable contributions to the codebase.
   
### Coding Conventions
The coding conventions for this codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/ProjectAGI/agi/wiki/Coding-Conventions). To make it easier for contributers to follow the coding guidelines, we provide a coding format for the IntelliJ IDEA development environment which can be found [here](./resources/code-format).

### Development Environment
Setting up a local development environment is necessary for advanced users or contributers who wish to submit bug fixes or improvements. The [technical documentation](./docs) contains the necessary information for setting up a local development environment, as well as information about system components and additional notes.
