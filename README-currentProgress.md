## To see what has been done regarding Swagger for Persistence:

- Checkout the branch SwaggerReintro
- Open src/experimental-framework/api-spec/persistence.yaml in a text editor
- Copy contents into the left pane in a browser at editor.swagger.io
- Have a look at the generated documentation. 
These are the calls that are now being used by Persistence.java

They are
      - nodes
      - entity-types


## Update and build project

- as explained in the README for the other generated libs, go to /lib/PersistenceClientLib and run 
```` 
mvn clean install
````

- On MacOSX, IntelliJ automatically loads the generated lib as a Maven dependency. If this does not happen, panic, then do your trick with the right Maven sidebar

- It should build in IntelliJ now

- Have a look at **Persistence.java** to see how it is used

- Note:
   - less code
   - nice code (nulls are not bad)
   - all java objects
   - if there is a failure, all information is in the exception
   - the spec to postgrest is now nicely documented for publication to community
   - the spec is very boilerplate-ish, it could be generated by a script pretty easily


## Making Changes

- make changes to yaml in   **editor.swagger.io**
- try it out by selecting 'Try Out Operation'
- If it doesn't work, just copy the json and url into 'Simple REST client' chrome extension or Curl
- Once happy, just copy the contents into the open **persistence.yaml** in your editor
- run **genPersistence.sh** keep developing (NOTE: for this you must follow instructions in README for generating code, it requires Swagger and setting the environment variables in the gen... shell scripts)

In order to run, you'll have to do the following.

- pull repo
- go to lib/CoordinatorClientLib and run 'mvn clean install'
- go to lib/CoordinatorServerLib and run 'mvn clean install'
- go to Coordinator project in IntelliJ, and run
- go to Agent project in IntelliJ, and run
- go to browser, and step the Coordinator ( http://localhost:8080/coordinator/control/step )
- observe that the Agent steps in the console of the Agent project

Note: CoordinatorClient/ServerLib terminology above should be replaced with 'core AGIEF server/client'

What has happened?

- The Coordinator launched a core AGIEF server
- The Agent launched a core AGIEF server
- The Agent requested the Coordinator to connect to it, passing a path to use
- The Coordinator connected
- You manually told the Coordinator to step, and it told all the connected Agents and Worlds


NOW: 
- to modify the spec to the actual control and state commands that we want, and make it do actual stuff
- fix bugs and continue developing for production version (see Pivotal)
