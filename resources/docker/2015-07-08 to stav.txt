stavy stavy, such a gorgeous kid

the absolute favourite part of my day is coming home and opening the front door

i hear 'daddy daddy daddy' and giggles 
you wave your hands up and down and run toward the door or the top of the stairs



you have always been very imaginative, and it is just getting better and better
today you got some play dough, and were making pizza and chips and 'eating' them

also so clever
i was sitting down with my legs straight out in front of me, feet pointing inwards touching each other
you rotated them outward, walked in between my legs, and i closed them again
we played like that a few seconds and you said "daddy gate, daddy gate", and walked in and out 



the other really funny thing that you say these days is "i need ...." for things you totally don't need, but just want :-)
